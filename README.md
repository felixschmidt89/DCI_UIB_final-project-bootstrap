# DCI-UIB-final_project-bootstrap_version

After having built [this website](https://uib-final-project.netlify.app/) from scratch I've decided to create a second version of it styled from scratch using **bootstrap**.

This is to showcase that besides having learned how to design & build websites **HTML**, **CSS** and **Sass** I've also learned the basics of **Bootstrap** during the very first technical module (**'User Interface Basic'**) as part of the Web Development Course at [Digital Career Institute](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/).
